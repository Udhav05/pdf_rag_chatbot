eraging. We present these results in Table 3.
In Table 3 rows (A), we vary the number of attention heads and the attention key and value dimensions,
keeping the amount of computation constant, as described in Section 3.2.2. While single-head
attention is 0.9 BLEU worse than the best setting, quality also drops off with too many heads.
In Table 3 rows (B), we observe that reducing the attention key size dk hurts model quality. This
suggests that determining compatibility is not easy and that a more sophisticated compatibility
function than dot product may be beneficial. We further observe in rows (C) and (D) that, as expected,
bigger models are better, and dropout is very helpful in avoiding over-fitting. In row (E) we replace our
sinusoidal positional encoding with learned positional embeddings [9], and observe nearly identical
results to the base model.
