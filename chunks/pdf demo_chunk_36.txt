increased the maximum output length to input length + 300. We used a beam size of 21 and Î± = 0.3
for both WSJ only and the semi-supervised setting.
Our results in Table 4 show that despite the lack of task-specific tuning our model performs sur-
prisingly well, yielding better results than all previously reported models with the exception of the
Recurrent Neural Network Grammar [8].
In contrast to RNN sequence-to-sequence models [37], the Transformer outperforms the Berkeley-
Parser [29] even when training only on the WSJ training set of 40K sentences.

Conclusion
In this work, we presented the Transformer, the first sequence transduction model based
