the Transformer to problems involving input and output modalities other than text and
to investigate local, restricted attention mechanisms to efficiently handle large inputs and outputs
such as images, audio and video. Making generation less sequential is another research goals of ours.
The code we used to train and evaluate our models is available at https://github.com/
