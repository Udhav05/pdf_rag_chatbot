Scaled Dot-Product Attention
We call our particular attention "Scaled Dot-Product Attention" (Figure 2). The input consists of
queries and keys of dimension dk, and values of dimension dv. We compute the dot products of the
query with all keys, divide each by √dk, and apply a softmax function to obtain the weights on the
values.
In practice, we compute the attention function on a set of queries simultaneously, packed together
into a matrix Q. The keys and values are also packed together into matrices K and V . We compute
the matrix of outputs as:
Attention(Q, K, V ) = softmax(QKT
